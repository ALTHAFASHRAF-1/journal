                            <p>The appearance of al-Dajjāl and the descent of Masīḥ Īsā is an integral part of the Islamic belief system according to the Last Day. Many debates have arisen around this topic generating arguments and counter arguments among the scholars of Islam. Naturally, there are two parties holding their opinions and providing scholarly evidences to support the stand. This study focuses on the Mushkilah Aḥadīth on the appearance of al-Dajjāl and the descent of Masīḥ Īsā, analysing the standpoints of both proponents and opponents. It attempts to critically reveal the strength and weakness of each submission. And the researcher reaches into conclusion based on the analytical study of Mushkilah Aḥadīth.</p>

                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>The appearance of Masīḥ ad-Dajjal and the descent of Masīḥ Īsā are considered among the major indications of the Last Hour. Masīḥ al-Dajjal is the impostor, who is supposed to precede the real Masīḥ Īsā before the End of Times, leading the people astray by imitating some strange deeds and by entering Jerusalem, after which he will be slayed by Masīḥ Īsā. A number of authentic aḥadīth of the Prophet (PBUH) attests to this. However, Muslim scholars differ in their opinions as to the reality of the text of such ahadith. While some denied the authenticity of these ahadith, claiming that there is no expressive statement in the Qūr'ān to justify the issue, others uphold the reality of the matter as contained in the authentic ahadith and the interpretation of the relevant verses of the Qūr'ān.</p>

                            <h2>The Genesis of the Controversy</h2>
                            <p>The controversy over the descent of Prophet Īsā as a sign of the Last Hour was triggered in the mid-20th century, by the fatwa of international ulamāʼ issued by Sheikh al-Azhar Mahmūd Shaltut, which stated that Prophet Īsā is already dead and will never descend at the End of Times. This contradicts the commonly held belief of the Muslims that Prophet Īsā was neither killed nor crucified, but was saved and raised to heaven by Allah, and his descent will be one of the major signs of the Last Hour. This is contained in the following noble verses:</p>
                            
                            <div class="quranic-verse">
                                <p>They said (in boast) "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the Apostle of Allah"; but they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no (certain) knowledge but only conjecture to follow for of a surety they killed him not.. Nay Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is exalted in Power Wise (4:157-158)</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Both parties differ in their interpretations of the Qurʼanic verses on the death of Prophet Īsā as follow:</p>
                            
                            <div class="quranic-verse">
                                <p>Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to myself (3:55)</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="quranic-verse">
                                <p>I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up thou was the Watcher over them and Thou art a Witness to all things. (5: 117)</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>The bone of contention revolves around the interpretation of tawaffa in 3: 55. The antagonists of the descent of Prophet Īsā render tawaffa as "death". They argue that the common Qurʼanic usage of tawaffa is death as in Qul yatawaffakum malakul maut Say: "The Angel of Death put in charge of you will (duly) take your souls" (32:11)</p>

                            <p>The foremost issue posed by the antagonists is that there are no indications in the noble Qūr'ān to support the appearance of al-Dajjāl (Anti-Christ) and the descent of Masih Īsā. The proponents provide the following answer: Beside the fact that great Mufassirun have indicated a number of verses in the Qūr'ān on this issue, the authentic ḥadīth of the Prophet (PBUH) is equally "wahy" (revelation from Allah) as stated in the noble verse: "Nor does he speak from (his own) inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed." As a result, his authentic ḥadīth is enough an evidence to justify the appearance of al-Dajjāl and the descent of Masih Īsā as two of major indications of the Last Hour as contained in many authentic aḥadīth, such as the following:</p>

In response, there was consensus of Muslim scholars on the Mutawātir (multiple-attested) status of aḥadith of the Prophet (PBUH) on the descent of Īsā (a.s.). Great Mufāssir, such as Imam al-Ṭabarī, Imam Alūsī and Ibn kathīr have stated in their tafsirs, when clarifying the verses indicating towards Īsā's descent, that the aḥadīth on this subject have reached tawātur and the Ummah has unanimously agreed upon this.</p>

                                <li>The matn (text of ḥadith) contains information contrary to a text of the Qūr'ān</li>

                            <p>This issue could have been a genuine and strong one if the Qūr'ān is the only source of guidance and authority in Islam. The fact that the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) also forms a part of guidance and authority in Islam has rendered this argument a very weak one. "And whatever the Messenger has given you – take; and whatever he has forbidden you – refrain from" (59:7)</p>
                            
                            <p>The answer provided by the proponents that the authentic hadith of the Prophet (PBUH) is equally "wahy" (revelation from Allah) as contained in the noble verse: "Nor does he speak from (his own) inclination.

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In conclusion, the fact that the belief in the appearance of Masih al-Dajjāl and the descent of Masīḥ Īsā at the Last Hour is closely connected to one of the six articles of faith in Islam, belief in the Last Day, has made this a point of special concern for the Muslim scholars. An ample of evidence exists in the Prophetic traditions. These traditions have been graded Mutawatir (multiple-attested) ahadith. Furthermore, indications to this in the Qūr'ān have also been provided by great Mufassirs (commentators). However, authentic ahadith of the Prophet (PBUH) is enough as evidence, since it is regarded as wahy (revelation).</p>
                            
                            <p>However, the Muslim scholars are of different opinions concerning the authenticity of the text of these ahadith. Thereby, the scholars are grouped into two classes of proponents and antagonists, based on their stand on this issue.</p>
                            
                            <p>The analysis of the various opinions of both parties revealed that the opinions of the proponents are very strong and tenable.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the light of the above, it is mandatory for Muslims to believe in the appearance of Masih ad–Dajjāl and the descent of Masih Īsā as part of major signs of the Last Hour. And also to believe in whatever the Prophet (PBUH) predicted to happen in the future, as this equally form a part of ilm al-ghayb (knowledge of unseen) without which the Īmān of Muslim is deficient.</p>
